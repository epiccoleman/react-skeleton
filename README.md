# React Skeleton

This is a minimalistic React project skeleton. Only decisions that are made for you are Babel, React, and Webpack. Short of including React with a script tag in your html, I believe this is just about the minimum you need to get started.

Shamelessly ripped off from [this article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#webpack-react-setup) by Robin Wieruch.

## First Time
Pull this down, probably delete the .git so you can make a new repo, and run `yarn install` (or `npm`)

## Running It
This project uses webpack-dev-server as its local dev server, run it with `yarn start` (or `npm`)
